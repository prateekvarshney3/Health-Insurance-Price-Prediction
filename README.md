# Health-Insurance-Price-Prediction
The majority of nations determine health insurance premiums based on a variety of variables, including age, the size of families, etc. Many businesses struggle with determining what the actual cost of health insurance for a single person or family should be. In order to forecast the cost of health insurance for potential future clients, one insurance company hired you as a data scientist. The samples needed to complete all data analysis and machine learning tasks have already been collected. Your job is to carry out each step of the data analysis process and then produce a machine learning model that forecasts the price of health insurance.
